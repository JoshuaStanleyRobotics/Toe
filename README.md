This repository includes the CAD (.step), code (.ino), and printing (STL) files for Toe, an Arduino powered bipedal robot.

The CAD and code for the remote control can be found in its own repository at https://github.com/JoshuaStanleyRobotics/Robot-Remote

A video outlining the design and assembly of Toe can be found here: 

## Components
Toe uses the custom MicroBot Control Board and Voltage Regulator. The design files for these PCBs can be found in their own repository at https://github.com/JoshuaStanleyRobotics/MicroBot

This design also uses four 9g servo motors, an ultrasonic distance sensor, and a 2S LiPo battery (I used https://us.ovonicshop.com/products/2-ovonic-11-1v-80c-800mah-2s-lipo-battery-with-jst-plug-for-250-helicopters-800mm-warbird?_pos=1&_psq=800maH+2&_ss=e&_v=1.0)
